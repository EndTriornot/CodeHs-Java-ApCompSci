Question: 2

Consider the following code snippet.
public static void main(String args[]){
    final int z;
    z = 20;
    z = 30;
    System.out.println(z);
}

This code gives an error.

int x = 7;            
double y = 2.0;             
boolean z = false;
x = x + 3;

x holds the int value 10, y holds the double value 2.0 and z holds the boolean value true.

        System.out.print("Total birds seen: ");
        System.out.println(totalBirds);
        System.out.print("Average time between sightings: ");
        System.out.println(averageTime);
        System.out.print("Most common bird seen was ");
        System.out.println(mostCommon);

Total birds seen: 150
Average time between sightings: 45.7
Most common bird seen was Mallard Duck

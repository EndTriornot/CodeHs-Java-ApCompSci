Question: 1

Each of the methods below can be found in the Rectangle class. Which of the following methods would have access to the parameter object’s private data and methods?

public void copy(Rectangle other)


Question: 2

Which of the following types can be permanently modified in a method when it is passed as a parameter to a method?

Any user defined class


Question: 3

It is considered good practice to

only modify objects when the method postcondition has specified the modification


Question: 4

Suppose you have the following methods defined
public double increaseWidth(double num){
        num += 10;
        return num;
}

public double increaseWidth(Rectangle rect){
        double newWidth = rect.getWidth() * 2;
        rect.setWidth(newWidth);

        return newWidth;
}
Consider this code snippet
double width = 10.5;
Rectangle room = new Rectangle(10, 15);
System.out.println(width);
System.out.println(room);
increaseWidth(width);
increaseWidth(room);
System.out.println(width);
System.out.println(room);
Which variable will have a different value the second time it is printed? Assume the toString method of Rectangle prints the rectangle’s dimensions.

room

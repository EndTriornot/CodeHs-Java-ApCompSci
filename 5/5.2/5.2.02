Question: 1

The Glasses class represents a pair of eyeglasses. One of its instance variables is a Prescription object called script. The Prescription object has instance variables that stores the prescription for the left and right eye.
Suppose the Glasses constructor was implemented as follows
    public Glasses(Prescription thePrescription)
    {
        script = thePrescription;
    }
What is the output of the following code snippet?
// Create a new Prescription object
Prescription reading = new Prescription(-1.25, -1.5);
// Create two new Glasses objects
Glasses myGlasses = new Glasses(reading);
Glasses yourGlasses = new Glasses(reading);
// Mutator for the prescription to change the prescription
reading.updatePrescription(-1.5, -1.5);
// Prints the glasses' prescription as
// (Left Eye, Right Eye) e.g. (-2.0, -2.5)
myGlasses.printPrescription();
yourGlasses.printPrescription();

(-1.5, -1.5)
(-1.5, -1.5)


Question: 2

An object’s state is defined by the object’s

instance variables and their values


Question: 3

If you do not implement a constructor for your class,

Java creates one for you and gives all instance variables default values


Question: 4

The Glasses class represents a pair of eyeglasses. One of its instance variables is a Prescription object called script. The Prescription object has instance variables that stores the prescription for the left and right eye.
Which of the following constructors for the Glasses class sets the script instance variable correctly? Assume any method calls are valid.

public Glasses(Prescription thePrescription)
{
script = new Prescription(thePrescription.getLeft(),thePrescription.getRight());
}

public class Circle
{
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double circleRadius)
    {
        radius = circleRadius;
    }
    public void setRadius(double newRadius)
    {
        radius = newRadius;
    }
    public void printDiameter()
    {
        double diameter = 2 * radius;
        System.out.println(diameter);
    }
}
What is the output of the main method below?

{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       Circle pizza = new Circle(12);
       pizza.printDiameter();
       pizza.setRadius(10);
       pizza.printDiameter();
    }
